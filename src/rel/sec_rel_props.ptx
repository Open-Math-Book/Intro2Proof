  <title>Properties of relations</title>
  <p>
    There are two special classes of relations that we will study
    in the next two sections, equivalence relations and ordering relations.
    The prototype for an equivalence relation is the ordinary notion
    of numerical equality, <m>=</m>. The prototypical ordering relation
    is <m>\leq</m>. Each of these has certain salient properties that are the
    root causes of their importance. In this section we will study a
    compendium of properties that a relation may or may not have.
  </p>

  <p>
    A relation that has three of the properties we'll discuss:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>reflexivity</h></idx> reflexivity
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>symmetry</h></idx>symmetry
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>transitivity</h></idx>transitivity
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    is said to be an equivalence relation; it will in some ways resemble
    <m>=</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A relation that has another set of three properties:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>reflexivity</h></idx>reflexivity
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>anti-symmetry</h></idx>anti-symmetry
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <idx><h>transitivity</h></idx>transitivity
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    is called an ordering relation; it will resemble <m>\leq</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, there is a property known as irreflexivity that many
    relations have.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a total of 5 properties that we have named, and we will discuss
    them all more thoroughly. But first, we'll state the formal definitions.
    Take note that these properties are all stated for a relation that goes
    from a set to itself, indeed, most of them wouldn't even make sense if
    we tried to define them for a relation from a set to a different set.

  <p>
    The digraph of a relation that is reflexive will have little loops at every vertex.
    The digraph of a relation that is irreflexive will contain no loops at all.
    Hopefully it is clear that these concepts represent extreme opposite possibilities <mdash /> they are <em>not</em> however negations of one another.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the logical denial of the property that says a relation is reflexive
        <me>
          {\lnot}(\forall a \in S,  a \relR a).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        How does this differ from the defining property for <q>irreflexive</q>?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is defined on some subset <m>S</m> of the reals, then it can be graphed
    in the Euclidean plane. Reflexivity for <m>\relR</m> can be interpreted in terms of the line
    <m>L</m> defined by the equation <m>y=x</m>. Every point in <m>(S \times S) \cap L</m>
    must be in <m>\relR</m>. A similar statement can be made concerning the irreflexive property.
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is irreflexive its graph completely avoids the line <m>y=x</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the reflexive and irreflexive properties are defined with a single quantified
    variable. Symmetry and anti-symmetry require two universally quantified variables for
    their definitions.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  A relation <m>\relR</m> on a set <m>S</m> is <em>symmetric</em> iff
  <me>
    \forall a,b \in S,  a \relR b \; \implies \; b \relR a.
  </me>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This can be interpreted in terms of digraphs as follows: If a connection
    from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> exists in the digraph of <m>\relR</m>, then there must also be a connection
    from <m>b</m> to <m>a</m>. In <xref ref="tab_rel_props" /> this is interpreted as <q>no one-way streets</q>
    and while that's not quite what it says, that <em>is</em> the effect of this definition.
    Since <em>if</em> a connection exists in one direction, there must also be a connection
    in the other direction, it follows that we will never see a one-way connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because most of the properties we are studying are defined using conditional statements
    it is often the case that a relation has a property for vacuous reasons. When the <q>if</q> part
    doesn't happen, there's no need for its corresponding <q>then</q> part to happen either <mdash /> the
    conditional is still true. In the context of our discussion on the symmetry property of
    a relation this means that the following digraph <em>is</em> the digraph of a symmetric
    relation (although it is neither reflexive nor irreflexive).
  </p>
<image><latex-image>\input{figures/vacuously_symmetric.tex}</latex-image></image>
  <p>
    Anti-symmetry is described as meaning <q>only one-way streets</q> but the definition is given
    as:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  A relation <m>\relR</m> on a set <m>S</m> is <em>anti-symmetric</em> iff 
  <m>\displaystyle \forall a,b \in S,  a \relR b \; \land b \relR a  \implies  a=b</m>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It may be hard at first to understand why the definition we use for anti-symmetry is the one above.
    If one wanted to insure that there were never two-way connections between elements of the set it
    might seem easier to define anti-symmetry as follows:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  (Alternate definition) A relation <m>\relR</m> on a set <m>S</m> is <em>anti-symmetric</em> iff 
  <m>\displaystyle \forall a,b \in S,  a \relR b \; \implies \; b \nrelR a</m>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This definition may seem more straight-forward, but it turns out the original definition is
    easier to use in proofs. We need to convince ourselves that the (first) definition really
    accomplishes what we want. Namely, if a relation <m>\relR</m> satisfies the property that
    <m>\displaystyle \forall a,b \in S,  a \relR b \; \land \; b \relR a  \implies  a=b</m>,
    then there will not actually be any pair of elements that are related in both orders. One
    way to think about it is this: suppose that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are distinct elements of <m>S</m> and
    that both <m>a \relR b</m> and <m>b \relR a</m> are true. The property now guarantees that <m>a=b</m>
    which contradicts the notion that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are distinct. This is a miniature proof
    by contradiction; if you assume there <em>are</em> a pair of distinct elements that are
    related in both orders you get a contradiction, so there <em>aren't</em>!
  </p>

  <p>
    A funny thing about the anti-symmetry property is this: When it is true of a relation it
    is <em>always</em> vacuously true! The property is engineered in such a way that when it is
    true, it forces that the statement in its antecedent never really happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transitivity is an extremely useful property as witnessed by the fact that both equivalence
    relations and ordering relations must have this property. When speaking of the transitive
    property of equality we say <q>Two things that are equal to a third, are equal to each other.</q>
    When dealing with ordering we may encounter statements like the following.
    <q>Since `Aardvark' precedes `Bulwark'
    in the dictionary, and since `Bulwark' precedes `Catastrophe', it is plainly true that `Aardvark'
    comes before `Catastrophe' in the dictionary.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, the definition of transitivity involves a conditional. Also, transitivity may be viewed
    as the most complicated of the properties we've been studying; it takes three universally
    quantified variables to state the property.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  A relation <m>\relR</m> on a set <m>S</m> is <em>transitive</em> iff 
  <m>\displaystyle \forall a,b,c \in S,  a \relR b \; \land \; b \relR c  \implies  a \relR c</m>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We paraphrased transitivity as <q>Whenever there's a roundabout route, there's a direct route.</q>
    In particular, what the definition says is that <em>if</em> there's a connection from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and from
    <m>b</m> to <m>c</m> (the roundabout route from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m>) then there must be a connection from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m> (the direct
    route).
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll really need to watch out for relations that are transitive for vacuous reasons. So long as one
    never has three elements <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> with <m>a \relR b</m> and <m>b \relR c</m> the statement that defines
    transitivity is automatically true.
  </p>

  <p>
    A very useful way of thinking about these various properties that relations may have is in terms of
    what <em>doesn't</em> happen when a relation has them. Before we proceed, it is important that
    you do the following
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find logical negations for the formal properties defining each of the five
        properties.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is reflexive we will never see a node that doesn't have a loop.
  </p>
<image><latex-image>\input{figures/not_reflexive.tex}</latex-image></image>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is irreflexive we will never see a node that <em>does</em> have a loop!
  </p>
<image><latex-image>\input{figures/not_irreflexive.tex}</latex-image></image>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is symmetric we will never see a pair of nodes that are connected in one
    direction only.
  </p>
<image><latex-image>\input{figures/not_symmetric.tex}</latex-image></image>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is anti-symmetric we will never see a pair of nodes that are connected in both
    directions.
  </p>
<image><latex-image>\input{figures/not_anti-symmetric.tex}</latex-image></image>
  <p>
    If a relation <m>\relR</m> is transitive the thing we will never see is a bit harder to describe.
    There will never be a pair of arrows meeting head to tail <em>without</em> there also being an
    arrow going from the tail of the first to the head of the second.
